[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

The `IMD` package provides easy access to the Indices of Multiple Deprivation for the UK's nations at various geographical levels:

- England: Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA), Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA), Ward, and Local Authority
- Wales: LSOA, MSOA, Ward, and Local Authority
- Scotland: Data Zone, Intermediate Zone, and Council Area
- Northern Ireland: Super Output Area and Local Government District

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matthewgthomas/IMD")
```

## Usage
The `IMD` package provides several datasets for the IMD in each UK nation:

### England

- Lower Layer Super Output Areas: `IMD::imd_england_lsoa`
- Middle Layer Super Output Areas: `IMD::imd_england_msoa`
- Wards: `IMD::imd_england_ward`
- Local Authorities: `IMD::imd_england_lad`

### Wales

- Lower Layer Super Output Areas: `IMD::imd_wales_lsoa`
- Middle Layer Super Output Areas: `IMD::imd_wales_msoa`
- Wards: `IMD::imd_wales_ward`
- Local Authorities: `IMD::imd_wales_lad`

### Scotland

- Data Zones: `IMD::imd_scotland_dz`
- Intermediate Zones: `IMD::imd_scotland_iz`
- Council Areas: `IMD::imd_scotland_lad`

### Northern Ireland

- Super Output Areas: `IMD::imd_northern_ireland_soa`
- Local Government Districts: `IMD::imd_northern_ireland_lad`

### Composite 2020 UK Index of Multiple Deprivation
We have also included the [composite 2020 UK Index of Multiple Deprivation](https://github.com/mysociety/composite_uk_imd) produced by mySociety, allowing comparison of deprivation across UK nations. For more information about how and when to use this version of the IMD, see [their README](https://github.com/mysociety/composite_uk_imd/blob/master/readme.md).

Rather than providing a copy of this data, the `IMD` package loads the data hosted on mySociety's GitHub. To load these files, run the following code:

```r
imd_uk <- load_composite_imd(nation = "E")
```

This function defaults to loading the England-focused composite index; change the `nation` parameter to the first letter of one of the devolved UK nations to load the other versions.

## Example

How many wards in Wales are there with the 100% of the population living in areas classified as among the most deprived?

```{r example}
library(IMD)

imd_wales_ward |> 
  dplyr::filter(Extent == 1) |> 
  dplyr::count()
```

## Getting help
If you encounter a clear bug, please file an issue with a minimal reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/matthewgthomas/IMD/issues).
